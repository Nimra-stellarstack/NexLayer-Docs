# Nexlayer API Reference

Welcome to the Nexlayer API Reference Documentation! This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Nexlayer AI Cloud Platform API.

Nexlayer is a product of AuditDeploy Inc., an applied research lab working on automating AI product deployment. We're building the deployer of the futureâ€”an AI agent that can take any codebase and turn it into a live, scalable product in seconds.

## Overview

The Nexlayer API enables you to build and deploy AI-powered applications with ease. This documentation provides detailed information about:

- Authentication and security
- API endpoints and usage
- YAML configuration
- SDKs and tools
- Best practices and examples

## Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy your first AI application
curl -X POST "https://app.nexlayer.io/startUserDeployment" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/x-yaml" \
  --data-binary @nexlayer.yaml
```

For detailed YAML configuration examples, visit our [Nexlayer Deployment YAML repository](https://github.com/Nexlayer/nexlayer-deployment-yaml).

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using session tokens. You'll receive a session token when starting a deployment, which you'll use for subsequent requests. See our [Authentication Guide](docs/guides/authentication.md) for details.
